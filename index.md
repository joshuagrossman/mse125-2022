## Course description

An increasing amount of data is now generated in a variety of disciplines, 
ranging from finance and economics, to the natural and social sciences.
Making use of this information requires both statistical tools and an
understanding of how the substantive scientific questions should drive
the analysis. In this hands-on course, we learn to explore and analyze
real-world datasets. We cover techniques for summarizing and describing data,
methods for statistical inference, and principles for effectively communicating 
results.

Prerequisites:
MS&E 120 or equivalent, and CS 106A or equivalent

For security reasons, the Zoom links for the discussion section and office hours are posted on [Canvas](https://canvas.stanford.edu/).

Office hours are a great opportunity to discuss not only topics directly related to the course, 
but also anything else that's on your mind beyond the class, including, for example, 
questions about career trajectories, and [research opportunities](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/msande-inclusion/diversity-in-research) in MS&E and beyond.

Please note that there are no regular office hours during the first week of class, but feel free to schedule an appointment if you would like to meet.

## Grading policies

- 7 homework assignments + project proposal (50%)
- 2 take-home quizzes (25%)
- Final project (20%)
- Attendance and participation (5%)

Late homework will not be accepted, but your lowest homework grade will be dropped.

Unless otherwise stated, assignments are to be done individually.
You are welcome to work with others to master the principles and approaches used to
solve the homework problems, but the work you turn in should be your own.
Under no circumstance should you seek out or look at solutions to assignments given in previous years.  

<!-- ## Study groups

We encourage you to work together in groups to solidify your understanding of the course material. 
If you would like assistance forming a study group, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/1xfXRZ968Xh9XEMY8) by Thursday, March 31 at 9pm PT. 
Our goal is to form the study groups the following day, 
so students can begin discussing the first homework assignment. -->

## Course communication 

We use the [Ed platform](https://edstem.org/us/courses/20790/discussion/) to manage course questions and discussion.

We highly encourage you to use our (anonymous) 
[comment box](https://forms.gle/XDECx7JKRNrM2BXq6)
to let us know which aspects of the class
are going well and which could be improved.

## Computing environment

We primarily use [R](http://www.r-project.org/), and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is the recommended interface.
We extensively use the suite of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages.

## Attendance

Office hours are not recorded. Lectures and the discussion section will be recorded, though we cannot guarantee audio or video quality.

<!-- * We do not plan on recording any component of the course. -->

* Lecture attendance is mandatory, and lecture attendance is a substantial component of the participation grade. We will periodically conduct attendance checks. If you cannot attend a lecture due to an extenuating circumstance, please email Josh before lecture starts. 

<!-- The teaching staff may periodically conduct attendance checks. -->

* Laptops and phones are not allowed in lecture, though you are permitted to use a tablet to take handwritten notes. [This article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html) explains why we have this policy.

* We highly encourage you to attend discussion sections, and be sure to bring your laptop. That being said, attendance is not mandatory. The discussion section will consist of one-on-one help with hands-on exercises that prepare you for the homework assignments. 

<!-- This experience is typically much more valuable and enjoyable if attended in person, though we will attempt to stream the discussion section via Zoom.  -->

## Diversity statement

It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit.
